SLOs are fundamental to manage a service correctly and a pillar of being a SRE. It took me a
fair amount of time to understand the importance of SLOs and it remains a challenge to define
and measure a meaningful SLO.

This repository is my attempt to make the point of importance of SLOs (once there is one, there
will be an error budget and everything else follows).

The goal is to provide a glossary, common classes of SLOs, links to common and uncommon
talks, books, events, yada yada. In the long run this hopefully turns into a collection of
patterns to achieve higher availability.

Patches/Content welcome!
